# Mastermind Game

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/45006e28-5bc0-4d75-aa62-3025556963c0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mastermind-lily/deploys)

The game is [deployed](https://mastermind-lily.netlify.com/) on Netlify, but I recommend running locally or checking out the version on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lilyhoratio/mastermind) due to small Netlify issues in loading animations.

## Overview

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where the user attempts to guess the digits of a secret PIN. It is a take on the [Mastermind board game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>).

The player must guess a 4 digit code that has been randomly generated by the computer. At the end of each try, the computer provides feedback on whether the player guessed a number correctly and/or a number and its location correctly. The computer's feedback does not reveal which number the player guessed correctly.

To win, the player must guess the right combinations within 10 attempts.

## Steps to run locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/lilyhoratio/mastermind.git`
2. `cd mastermind`
3. `yarn` to install dependencies
4. `yarn start` to launch React app
5. `yarn test` to run tests

## Features

MVP:

- [x] Ability to guess the combinations of 4 numbers
- [x] Ability to view the history of guesses and their feedback
- [x] The number of guesses remaining is displayed
- [x] A random number is generated using the random.org API

Extra features:

- [x] Ability to toggle viewing the code combination for easier user testing
- [x] Conditional rendering of won game vs. lost game pop-ups
- [x] Ability to restart the game by generating a new code combination (in pop-up when user wins or loses game, and the "Generate new code" component) which resets relevant state
- [x] Computer gives feedback after each guess with the count of exact (correct digit/location) vs. fuzzy matches (correct digit, not location)
- [x] User is prevented from accessing the input form after guessing the correct combination or when they reach 10 tries (form disappears)

![Modal-win](modal-win.gif)

- [x] Pacman ghost animation alert with conditional text for invalid inputs when the user:

  - types in non-integers
  - types an invalid digit (not between 0-7)
  - enters nothing
  - enters guess with more than 4 digits

- [x] Clippy (ðŸ“Ž) animation when user wants to change difficulty, which prompts the user to change the number of max tries allowed.

![Error-handling](error-handling.gif)

- [x] Ability to update game difficulty by changing the following (in progress!):
  - [x] the number of total tries allowed
  - [x] the max digit in the code (possible digits span from 0-5 to 0-7) --> recalls API with updated params
  - [x] the total number of digits in the code --> recalls API with updated params
  - [x] affected state is highlighted in momentarily highlighted upon change difficulty form submission
  - [ ] to-do: update the ghost's conditional text for new difficulties (e.g. alert for invalid numbers)
